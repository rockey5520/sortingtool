<p>The first line contains number <span class="math-tex">\( 1 \le n \le 10^5 \)</span>, second one â€”
  array <span class="math-tex">\( A[1\ldots n] \)</span>, containing natural numbers not greater
  than <span class="math-tex">\( 10^9 \)</span>. You need to calculate the number of pairs of
  indexes&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\( 1 \le i \lt j \le n \)</span>, for which <span
      class="math-tex">\( A[i] \gt A[j] \)</span>.</p>
<p>Such pair of elements is called the inversion. The number of inversion in the array is in some
  way its measure of random nature: for example, there are no inversions at all in an array arranged
  in a non-decreasing order, and in an array, arranged in descending order, every two elements form
  an inversion.</p>
<p>The result should be long, because an array can contain a lot of inversions.</p>
<p>For example, the sequence <span class="math-tex">\(2, 4, 1, 3, 5\)</span> has three inversions:
  <span class="math-tex">\((2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Modify merge sort and solve the problem using it.</p>
